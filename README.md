# UFO_Mod_12_Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a table to the public that logs when potential UFO Sightings occurred. Additionally, provides data about where the sighting happened, what the potential UFO looked like, how long it was in sight, and additional context about the encounter. This site was built using JavaScript and it provides a dynamic table that enables the viewer to pinpoint their research if they so choose.

 ## Results 
 
As see below, the initial page displays a table that documents all sightings in 2010. However, this table is dynamic and allows you to drill down using the filters on the left.


For example, if you would like to view all UFO sightings in your state you can enter you state's initials and the table will filter to sightings in your state. Please see below:


Additionally, this table considers multiple criteria. If you wanted to see all sightings in your state and the sighting had a specific shape you could do this! Below is an example of all sightings in Missouri that looked like a fireball.


## Summary

In summary, this site that shares this dynamic table of UFO sightings with the world provides a lot of value. Not only does it share the sightings, but helps people conduct research through the filtering it offers.

 ### One Drawback
 
 * The date filter only enables the viewer to see sightings on a specific day. It would be nice if the date filter provided a way for people to view sightings throughout a month or certain range of dates. Additionally this is just a table, it would be nice to provide some visualizations to help the viewer digest the overall picture of sightings in 2010 or at least provide some conditional formatting to the table.
 
### Two Recommendations

 1. Connected with the drawback(s) above, I would recommend adding a different date filter that can provide a range of results would provide added value as well as any visualizations or conditional formatting to help the viewer more easily digest and understand UFO sightings in 2010.
 2.
